description: Sayan was more than a brilliant mentorâ€”he was a heartfelt presence in every interaction. His patience and warmth shone clearly when he introduced my children to guitar, transforming a simple lesson into a cherished memory. We will always remember his kindness, his generous spirit, and the gentle guidance he offered to all who knew him.
