description: Sayan was a uniquely talented scholar with several intriguing intellectual pursuits. It was my pleasure to know him and to absorb some of his thoughts on high-dimensional geometric concepts especially as they pertained to spatial statistics. I will remember him fondly and forever through the many interactions I had with him over the years and specifically during my sabbatical in Duke in 2009. Gone too soon. My sincere condolences to his entire family.
