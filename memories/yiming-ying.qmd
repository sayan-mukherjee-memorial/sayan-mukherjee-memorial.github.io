description: "Throughout my career, Sayan was not only a supportive colleague and friend  but also a generous and encouraging presence. His intellectual rigor, quiet strength, and kindness left a lasting impact on those around him.<br><br>

I will always remember his thoughtful feedback, his willingness to help without hesitation, and the calm wisdom he brought to every conversation we had. Sayanâ€™s support during pivotal moments in my professional journey meant more than any words that I can express.<br><br>

He will be greatly missed, both for his contributions to our field and for the warmth and integrity with which he carried himself. My thoughts are with his family, friends, and all who had the privilege to work alongside him. "
