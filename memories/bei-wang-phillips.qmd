description: Sayan was brilliant and funny. He was a wonderful mentor, colleague, and friend. As I write this, tears well up in my eyes. It has been two weeks since his passing, and I’ve delayed writing this because, in some way, it feels like if I don’t finish this piece, he’s still around—to tell me, “alles ist gut.” I miss him deeply. I met Sayan in 2004, when I began graduate school at Duke and he had just started there as a new assistant professor. I remember a moment after a meeting in his office when he said, “Guns and roses—can you believe that’s the only thing we can’t buy with a Duke purchase card?” Sayan was on my PhD committee and, over the years, became a steadfast mentor and friend, walking with me through many challenging times. Fast forward to 2023—he was one of my hosts in Leipzig during my sabbatical, and I truly enjoyed our conversations about math and everything else. I miss him so much. I miss the times we spent at the Federal. I miss the drinks with him in the Leipzig Marktplatz. I miss his jokes. Dear Sayan, I hope "alles ist gut" in heaven.
