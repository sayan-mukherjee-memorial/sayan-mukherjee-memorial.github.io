description: I met Sayan on one of my first days at Duke in a coffee shop with Jonathan Mattingly. His curiosity, enthusiasm for math, and friendliness were a wonderful introduction to the Duke community. He was hilarious, a deep thinker, and incredibly kind. From jointly serving on PhD committees to exploring Durham whisky bars, Sayan was a great friend and colleague. He will be sorely missed.
