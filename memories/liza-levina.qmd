description: I have so many memories of Sayan, from all the dinners, walks, and conversations we have shared over the years at various workshops and conferences. All of them are filled with his unique warmth, humor, brilliance, and, of course, t-shirts.  He was so kind, so funny, and so full of life... what a terrible loss. May his memory be a blessing to all who loved him.
