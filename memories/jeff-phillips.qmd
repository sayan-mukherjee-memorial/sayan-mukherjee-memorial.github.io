description: I took Sayan's first course at Duke (statistical learning theory).  His masterful and no-filter approach made the material mesmerizing in ways that still influences my thinking today. This mirrored how he approached all aspects of life, and he has been an important mentor and friend for 20 years. His kindness, intellect, honesty, and humor were contagious, and lifted everyone around him -- and that effect still live on.
