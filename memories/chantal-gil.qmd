description: I am deeply saddened by the loss of my dear friend and neighbor, Sayan. His presence was marked by his unmistakable laughâ€”bold and always contagious. You always knew Sayan was near from the warmth of his humor and the kindness he showed to those around him. He was thoughtful, caring, and brought light into our lives in ways that will never be forgotten. Sayan will be missed greatly. May his memory be a blessing.
