description: I was incredibly fortunate to have Sayan as my PhD co-adviser. He was deeply supportive—intellectually, professionally, and personally—and always made time for thoughtful guidance. During the pandemic, he still showed up for a makeup hooding ceremony and took a photo with me. That gesture meant a lot and captured who he was. I noticed I'm still listed as his “current” group member on his website, even five years after graduating—it’s a small thing, but it speaks volumes about his lasting connection and care.
