description: I had the great pleasure of getting to know Sayan during his time in Leipzig. His laid-back nature and openness made it easy to connect with him. 
Over the years, we shared inspiring conversations—about music, philosophy, and life.
Above all, he often spoke of his son, whom he loved more than anything. That deep affection was always present in his stories. I had the honor of spending time with him during his final chapter—sharing moments of laughter, struggle, and quiet reflection. Those memories will stay with me always, and I’m truly grateful for every one of them. Sayan left a profound mark on my life, and while I am incredibly saddened that he is no longer with us, I am grateful that his memory and the impact he had will continue to inspire many.
