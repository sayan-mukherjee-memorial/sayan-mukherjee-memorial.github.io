description: You spent time with Sayan because he was so fun, but you came away believing in yourself more, paradoxically questioning yourself more, and wanting to be a better person to be worthy of his belief in you. I can’t overstate the impact he had on me in my first two years here at Duke as chair of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics. I appreciate how he gently prodded me with questions, rather than arguing with me, when he wasn’t convinced I was right about something. I miss him terribly.
