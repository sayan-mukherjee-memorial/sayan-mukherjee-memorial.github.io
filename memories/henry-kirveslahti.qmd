description: "I first met the free spirited Sayan on Aug 21, 2017. It was the day of the solar eclipse. Back then, I was already a fan of his creative research. As I came to know him, I started to appreciate him even more for his compassionate and likable personality,  as wells as for his intellectual and lightheartedly mischievous view towards life. As I knew him, he was a modest, no BS man of great intellect and high moral fiber, a friend with a lot of stimulating, positive energy, and a mentor with the patience of a saint. I can not believe he is gone. Thank you Sayan, for having made this world a more bearable place to live in. This was too short, but I'm glad I had the chance to know you."
