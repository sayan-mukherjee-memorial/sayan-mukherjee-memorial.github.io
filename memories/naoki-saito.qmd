description: I am very sorry to hear Sayan's sudden and unexpected passing. Sayan was a fantastic mathematician/statistician with deep geometric insight. People here at UC Davis invited him at least twice, one in 2016 and the other in 2018, for his lectures and talks, which my students and I enjoyed very much. In addition, he and I were directors of the NSF-TRIPODS institutes at our respective places (Duke and UC Davis), and discussed many issues. Last year, I bumped into him in a conference, and he strongly suggested that I should visit him in Leipzig. I wish I could have visited him, but it was not materialized. He was a very friendly and warm person. I miss him dearly. To his family and loved ones, please accept my sincere condolences.
