description: I have never known someone so full of life as Sayan. Whether he was raving about beautiful mathematical ideas, giving heartfelt advice on a late night walk, or regaling us with statistics lore or tales from his own mischief, Sayan was really telling us about what it is to be human. Above all his brilliance, I will remember him for his singular kindness. His wild and generous spirit was a guiding force for many, and I owe him a great debt for shepherding us misfits through this world. I miss you friend.
