description: I met him during my interview for assistant prof at Duke.  From then on it was always fun talking to him, he really enjoyed science and sharing ideas, he had both depth and breath of knowledge, and also had a great sense of humor.  I will always be indebted to him, as he took enough personal interest to act as an informal mentor, even though he was not even in my department.  His mentorship included meeting over lunch to discuss grant ideas, and he actually read my grant proposals, all of which was more than most other faculty have done for me and put him in very select company.  He was a truly great guy!
