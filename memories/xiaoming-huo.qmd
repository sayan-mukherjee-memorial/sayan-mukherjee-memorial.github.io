description: I’m deeply saddened by Sayan's passing. I had the privilege of working with him on two joint proposals, and during our brainstorming sessions, I was always struck by his remarkable ability to take seemingly unrelated ideas and shape them into a compelling, coherent narrative. Beyond his brilliance, Sayan brought warmth and wit to every conversation. His jokes and anecdotes during meals brought laughter and connection — moments we’ll hold onto dearly. The statistics community has lost a true genius, and I’ve lost a respected collaborator and a kind friend. He will be profoundly missed.
