description: Outspoken, witty, ambitious but very human and always generous. Sayan will always stay with me. Well, I hope beyond me too—in the memory of my son—as I have many stories we shared together yet to tell him (some of which are best saved for when he's a bit older and his mother isn’t listening), from the weila weila waia to the famous adventure of the English tobacco, and—without joking—many more moments that made my early years as a researcher at MIT a turning point in my life. Rest in peace my dear friend. Your fearless leader.
