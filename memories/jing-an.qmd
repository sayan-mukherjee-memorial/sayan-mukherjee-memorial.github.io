description: Sayan was a brilliant and warm-hearted mathematician and statistician. I met him during my year at the Max Planck Institute, just as he was beginning his new position there. We discussed several potential research projects together. Although we didnâ€™t end up collaborating directly, I was deeply impressed by his enthusiasm, creativity, and the freshness of his ideas. I was heartbroken to hear of his sudden passing. It is a devastating loss for his family and friends, and a big loss for the math community.
