description: The last time I saw Sayan was in April 2023. We spent a lovely day walking across Leipzig. Our conversation flowed between mathematics, biology, politics and family. His insights, humor, and wit refreshed my soul. Most of all I remember his laughter. We both wished we were colleagues at the same university, and made plans to work together.
