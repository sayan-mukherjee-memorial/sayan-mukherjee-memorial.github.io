description: Sayan, my cousin, is no more - it’s a very big jolt to all of us here in India. It’s beyond our imagination and belief that he is not amongst us. Such a brilliant student, teacher, scientist and above all a human being leading a simple life is rare in this world. It’s our sheer bad luck that such a genius departed so early. RIP bro…🙏💐🙏
