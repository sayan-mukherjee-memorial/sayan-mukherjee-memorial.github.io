description: I remember vividly the first time I met Sayan; I knew his reputation as a mathematician and statistician, but I didn't know what a warm, kind, and down to earth person he was. He radiated such humanity! He was enormously gifted -- both scientifically and interpersonally; we are so lucky that he shared his gifts with us. And, he had so much more to give and receive in this world. His loss is a tragedy.
