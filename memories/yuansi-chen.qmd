description: Sayan was a brilliant person. One can quickly sense his enthusiasm for deep results while talking to him. The conversation I had with Sayan during my job interview at Duke in 2019 was inspiring and it continues to motivate me to be a better researcher. He was always warm-hearted and fun to work with as a colleague. I'm grateful to have known him.
