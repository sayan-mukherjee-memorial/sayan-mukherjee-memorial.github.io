description: Sayan was a golden unicorn with rainbow. He is a renaissance man, a magician who make connections between seemingly unrelated topics across a wide range of fields. He had great taste in science, as well as music, food, and, of course, attire. He was a teddy bear who was ready to give everyone a hug in bad times. I will always remember his talent, warmth, humor, and above all, humanity. Sayan, thank you for all the fun and memories. We miss you dearly.
