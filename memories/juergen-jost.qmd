description: I have seen Sayan in exuberant and joyful moments, and in dark ones. In every encounter, he deeply impressed me with his creativity, his understanding of mathematics that was both intuitive and deep, his wide ranging interests and knowledge, and his human warmth, sensitivity and generosity. I miss him deeply as a friend, a colleague and a profoundly human being.
