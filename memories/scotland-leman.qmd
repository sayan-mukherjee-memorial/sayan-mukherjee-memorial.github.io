description: "Sayan was a bright light in the lives of everyone who knew him. His brilliance, warmth, and comedy was always uplifting and inspiring. His sense of humor was unavoidable, unique, and shocking in the best possible ways. <br><br>

His friendship and mentorship was always in balance: offering words of humor when things were serious, yet words of wisdom when needed.<br><br>

Sayan's presence was truly a gift. "
