description: Sayan was a unique scholar â€“ a brilliant mind with a down-to-earth accessibility.  I was department chair at the time his appointment was moved from Biostatistics and Bioinformatics to Statistical Science.  I knew he was a wonderful catch for our group.  And, over time, we all came to appreciate the thoughtful perspective, the intellectual generosity, the warm nature and humor that he brought to the Department.
